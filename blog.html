        <p class="ml-16 mt-3 font-bold">
          Ans:<br />
          "let", "var", "const" are the keyWord to declare a variable. But their
          scope are different. <br /><br />
          Mainly "var" is function-scoped as well as global-scope. That means it
          can be accessable before it's declaretion."var" is hoisted to the top
          of the entire code. That's why, "var" is less safe than the others.
          "var" can be re-assigned as well as can be re-declared. It holds it's
          initial value 'undefined' <br /><br />
          "let" is blocked-scoped, that means it can be accessed within the
          curly braces. It cann't be accessed outside of the function or block.
          "let" can be re-assigned but can't be re declared like "var". It has
          no hoisting behaviour. <br /><br />
          On the other Hand, "const" is also block-scoped and almost similar to
          "let" but it can't be re-declared as well as re-assigned, this is one
          of the main difference between "let" and "const". It's mandetory to
          set a value to "const". It mainly used when there is no need to change
          it's value.

        <p class="text-xl">Q2. Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</p>
        <p class="ml-16 mt-3 font-bold">
          Ans: <br />
          Use Cases of "undefined" <br />
          1. It's used to indicate missing value of a variable. <br />
          2. As a default value in function parameters to handle missing
          arguments. <br />
          3. We can check that a variable is assigned a value or not.
          <br /><br />
          On the other hand, Type of null is 'Object'<br />
          Use cases of "null"<br />1. To clear an Object or variable. <br />2.
          To indicate intentional absence of value. <br />3. As a replacment of
          a value that will assigned later.
