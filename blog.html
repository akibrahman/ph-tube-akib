          Q1. Discuss the scope of var, let, and const
        </p>
        <p class="ml-16 mt-3 font-bold">
          Ans:<br />
          <span class="font-black italic underline">let</span>,
          <span class="font-black italic underline">var</span>,
          <span class="font-black italic underline">const</span> are the keyWord
          to declare a variable. But their scope are different. <br /><br />
          Mainly <span class="font-black italic underline">var</span> is
          function-scoped as well as global-scope. That means it can be
          accessable before it's declaretion.<span
            class="font-black italic underline"
            >var</span
          >
          is hoisted to the top of the entire code. That's why,
          <span class="font-black italic underline">var</span> is less safe than
          the others. <span class="font-black italic underline">var</span> can
          be re-assigned as well as can be re-declared. It holds it's initial
          value 'undefined' <br /><br />
          <span class="font-black italic underline">let</span> is
          blocked-scoped, that means it can be accessed within the curly braces.
          It cann't be accessed outside of the function or block.
          <span class="font-black italic underline">let</span> can be
          re-assigned but can't be re declared like
          <span class="font-black italic underline">var</span>. It has no
          hoisting behaviour. <br /><br />
          On the other Hand,
          <span class="font-black italic underline">const</span> is also
          block-scoped and almost similar to
          <span class="font-black italic underline">let</span> but it can't be
          re-declared as well as re-assigned, this is one of the main difference
          between <span class="font-black italic underline">let</span> and
          <span class="font-black italic underline">const</span>. It's mandetory
          to set a value to
          <span class="font-black italic underline">const</span>. It mainly used
          when there is no need to change it's value.

          Q2. Tell us the use cases of null and undefined
        </p>
        <p class="ml-16 mt-3 font-bold">
          Ans: <br />
          Use Cases of
          <span class="font-black italic underline">undefined</span> <br />
          1. It's used to indicate missing value of a variable. <br />
          2. As a default value in function parameters to handle missing
          arguments. <br />
          3. We can check that a variable is assigned a value or not.
          <br /><br />
          On the other hand, Type of null is 'Object'<br />
          Use cases of <span class="font-black italic underline">null</span
          ><br />1. To clear an Object or variable. <br />2. To indicate
          intentional absence of value. <br />3. As a replacment of a value that
          will assigned later.

        <p class="ml-16 mt-3 font-bold">
          Ans: <br />
          The <span class="font-black italic underline">REST API</span>, also
          known as the­ Representational State­ Transfer Application Programming
          Interface, e­ncompasses a collection of architectural principle­s and
          constraints that guide the design of ne­tworked applications. This
          widely embrace­d approach facilitates seamless communication be­tween
          software applications through the­ internet, enabling e­ffective web
          se­rvice developme­nt.
